			<h2>What is Climate Change and Global Warming?</h2>
			<p>Climate change is the long-term change in the average weather patterns that define Earth's climates. 
			These changes have a wide range of effects that are synonymous to the term.
			<br>
			Global warming is the long-term heating period of the Earth's climate system due to human activites, usually fossil fuel burning, which increases the greenhouse gas levels in the Earth's atmosphere.

			<h4>Since the pre-industrial period, human activites are estimated to have increased the Earth's global average temperature by about 1 degree Celsius.</h4> 
			It is obvious that human influences have warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land.

				<ul>
					<li><h2>Sea Level Rise</h2><img src="../images/rising sea levels pic.jpg" alt="Picture of a traffic sign engulfed in water."><footer class="picsources">Source:(Photo by Kelly Sikkema on unsplash.com)</footer>
					<h4>Sea levels will rise by 2100. Rising sea levels could impact 1 billion people by 2050. If global warming increases the temperature of Earth by 1.5 degrees Celsius, the sea level will rise 1.5 feet.</h4></li>
					<li><h2>Coral Bleaching</h2><img src="../images/coral bleaching pic.jpg" alt="Picture of a dead coral reef."><footer class="picsources">Source:(Photo by Ahmed Areef on unsplash.com)</footer>
					<h4>The changes in water temperature cause algae to leave coral reefs leaving them vulnerable to disease and death. If the Earth increases temperature by 2 degrees celsius, virtually all coral reefs will die in the result of Coral Bleaching.</h4></li>
					<li><h2>Melted Ice Caps</h2><img src="../images/melting ice caps pic.jpg" alt="Picture of a glacier in the Arctic."><footer class="picsources">Source:(Photo by Cassie Matias on unsplash.com)</footer>
					<h4>The ice caps of the arctic will melt causing a domino effect of rising sea levels and the animals there to lose their habitats. If global warming continues, ice free summers could be a reality. If the temperature of the Earth increases by 2 degrees, we would have ice-free Arctic summers at least one a decade.</h4></li>
					<li><h2>Heat Waves</h2><img src="../images/heat waves pic.jpg" alt="Picture of a desert."><footer class="picsources">Source:(Photo by Giorgo Parravicini on unsplash.com)</footer>
					<h4>Heat waves will become more frequent and severe around the world affecting everyone if we don't act on Global Warming. People will be exposed to extreme heat waves every five years with it affecting 2.7 billion people if the temperature of Earth increases by 2 degrees Celsius.</h4></li>
					<li><h2>Flooding</h2><img src="../images/flooding pic.jpg" alt="Picture of a flood."><footer class="picsources">Source:(Photo by Chris Gallagher on unsplash.com)</footer>
					<h4>Global warming increases the risk for more frequent and heavier rainfall, snowfall, and other types of precipitation. And as those risks increase, so does the risk of flooding. If the temperature of Earth increases by 2 degrees Celsius, the risk of flooding increases by 170%.</h4></li>
					<li><h2>Loss of Wildlife Habitat</h2><img src="../images/loss of habitat pic.jpg" alt="Picture of a polar bear."><footer class="picsources">Source:(Photo by Annie Spratt on unsplash.com)</footer>
					<h4>Crucial habitats for up to 19 % animals and plants may no longer be hospitable causing many species to be at risk if they cannot adapt or move. Around 18% of insects, 16% of plants, and 8% of vertebrates will be at risk if the temperature of Earth increases by 2 degrees Celsius.</h4></li>
					<li><h2>Longer Wildfire Seasons</h2><img src="../images/wildfire pic.jpg" alt="Picture of a forest fire."><footer class="picsources">Source:(Photo by Malachi Brooks on unsplash.com)</footer>
					<h4>Wildfire seasons may be months longer which releases even more CO2 into the air creating a cycle of longer wildfire seasons, wildfires release more CO2, then longer wildfire seasons.</h4></li>
