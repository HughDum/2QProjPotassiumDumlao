			<p>Before we start talking about how Nuclear Energy can help us, we need to first understand how it works. Nuclear power comes from nuclear power plants that go through a process known as nuclear fission. In nuclear fission, a neutron collides with an atom and splits it, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation. Most nuclear power plants use uranium atoms. This heat is then used to boil water to create steam that spins a turbine that creates electricity.</p>

				<h4>The way nuclear power plants generates power is through nuclear fission that releases a large amount of heat. That heat is used to boil water and create steam that spins a turbine and generates electricity. The byproducts released by this process is only steam. In comparison to other methods of generating energy like coal burning, nuclear power is an excellent source of power, for the time being, that does not destroy the atmosphere.</h4></li>
				<li><h2>Nuclear Energy has a small land footprint</h2><img id="portrait-pic" src="../images/nuclear energy-land footprint pic.jpg"><footer class="picsources">Source:(Photo by Patrick Federi on Unsplash)</footer>
				<h4>Nuclear power plants produce more electricity on less land than any other clean-air source. A usual 1000-megawatt nuclear facility in the US needs a little more than 1 square mile to run. Compared to wind farms that need 360 times more land area or solar plants that need 75 times more space, nuclear power gains the advantage.</h4></li>
				<li><h2>Nuclear Energy creates little waste</h2><img src="../images/nuclear energy-little waste pic.png"><footer class="picsources">Source:(Image by US Department of Energy)</footer>
				<h4>Nuclear fuel is 1 million times greater than that of other traditional energy resources as nuclear fuel is extremely dense. One uranium pellet one inch tall has equal amounts of energy as 17,000 cubic ft of natural gas, 120 gallons of oil, or 1 ton of coal.</h4></li>
				<li><h2>Nuclear plant death rates are less destructive than other industrial death rates</h2><img src="../images/nuclear energy-death rate.png"><footer class="picsources">Source:(Graph by  Madhumitha Jaganmohan)</footer><h4>Now I know what you're thinking, if nuclear power is so good, then why is there so much controversy about it being catastrophic. Well yes, those incidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi were terrible; a showcase of what could happen when nuclear power goes wrong. But this terror of nuclear power was only regarded so highly due to them being highly publicized events. According to the graph of Mortality rate worldwide in 2012, by energy source by Madhumitha Jaganmohan, the death rate from coal energy is one of the highest in the world at an estimate of 100,000 deaths per terawatt hour. Ths death rate is based on mining operations and the actual use of energy. Air pollution due to burning coal is also a growing concern as it is linked to asthma, cancer, and heart disease. In comparison, nuclear energy was considered the safest energy source, even after including nuclear catastrophes like Cherynobyl and Fukushima.</h4></li>
