			Other than just preventing Climate Change through your small actions like recycling or planting trees around your house, you can also donate money to Charities dedicated to stopping Climate Change. Donating is a great way to promote and help those who are actively trying to stop global warming. It helps them do what they can to help, and in return you feel satisfied with an improved sense of wellbeing.
